    <div class="News">
      <p>The SAT is a well-known standardized test used by colleges and universities to evaluate the academic readiness of high school students for college. It has been a long-standing tradition and is considered a reliable measure of a student's college readiness. However, the SAT has faced criticism in recent years for being too focused on rote memorization and lacking in real-world problem solving skills, which are important for success in college.</p> 
<p>In an effort to address these criticisms and provide a more accurate measure of college readiness, the SAT has announced a major change: the addition of a Flappy Bird section to the test.</p>
<p>The Flappy Bird section of the SAT will be a timed game in which students must navigate a bird through a series of pipes, testing their ability to plan ahead and think strategically. The SAT hopes that this game will be able to measure a student's critical thinking skills and ability to solve problems in a fast-paced environment. It is also expected to be more engaging for students than the traditional sections, as it will be designed to be fun and enjoyable.</p>

<p>The SAT is making this change in response to the evolving needs of students and the changing educational landscape. While it remains to be seen whether the Flappy Bird section will be successful in improving the accuracy of the SAT as a measure of college readiness, it is certainly an interesting and innovative change for the long-standing test.</p>
