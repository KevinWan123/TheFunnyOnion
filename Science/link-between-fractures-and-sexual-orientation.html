    <div class="Title">Surprising Link Between Fractures and Sexual Orientation Uncovered by Researchers</div>
    <div class="Date">Dec 15, 2022 - Carl Sagan</div>

    <div class="News"><p>Recent research has uncovered a surprising link between fractures and sexual orientation. According to a study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, individuals who have sustained a fracture, particularly to the arm, are more likely to identify as gay or bisexual. Furthermore, those who sustained their fracture while engaging in high-risk activities, such as skateboarding, are even more likely to identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
        <p>The study, which was conducted by a team of researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, analyzed the medical records of over 10,000 individuals who had sustained a fracture. The researchers found that, compared to individuals who had not sustained a fracture, those who had were significantly more likely to identify as gay or bisexual.</p>
        <p>But the most striking finding was the link between high-risk activities and sexual orientation. The study found that individuals who sustained a fracture while engaging in activities such as skateboarding, snowboarding, or rock climbing were even more likely to identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

        <p>The researchers caution that their study does not prove that breaking a bone causes an individual to be gay or bisexual. However, they suggest that the link between fractures and sexual orientation may be due to a common underlying factor, such as genetics or hormonal changes.</p>
        <p>Further research is needed to understand the exact nature of this link, and to determine whether there is any causal relationship between fractures and sexual orientation. In the meantime, the researchers encourage individuals who have sustained a fracture, especially to the arm, to be open and accepting of their sexual orientation, and to seek support if needed. It is important to note that the findings of this study should not be used to stigmatize or discriminate against individuals who have sustained a fracture or who identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community. Instead, these findings should be used to further our understanding of the complex relationship between physical and mental health, and to provide support and care for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or medical history.</p></div>
