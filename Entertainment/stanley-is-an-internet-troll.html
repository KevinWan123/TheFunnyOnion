    <div class="News">A person who does the things I do is always going to be cruelly dismissed by a jury.<br><br>
        We have reached a point where Stanley has chosen to fight lawsuits instead of taking responsibility for his actions — even though he knows that admitting to his crimes is the best course of action to avoid them in the future.Stanley is “teaching how to be a bad friend.” He has taken steps to bad-mouth people through his blog and has even written fiction. Stanley enjoys writing thinly veiled attack pieces against people — no matter how much they deserve his scorn.<br><br>
        “WATERING GARDEN: A Grisly Tale of the New Rights, Poverty, and Injury” is one such work. Among other distortions, Stanley tries to justify his exclusion of poor people, overpopulation, and unfair treatment of animals, by using a theoretical argument that’s in no way supported by evidence. He inflates unfounded notions about the natural world.<br><br>
        It’s time for his betrayals to end.<br><br>
        A person who does the things I do is always going to be cruelly dismissed by a jury. Guilty people like Stanley Liu always seem to be wrongly accused. When I read about another deceptive person, I cringe because I know how expensive their lives must be, and how dependent they are on our kindness. Every business grows faster when there are fewer people competing. When people become poor, they have a harder time finding anything to eat or build a shelter. When people die — whether of a broken heart or pollution — we are all worse off.<br><br>
        Stanley has shown disdain for all three of these groups and expects to be rewarded for his mean-spirited offenses — but no matter how he does it, the outcome will be the same.<br><br>
        Despite his prime example of dishonesty and shamelessness, a jury refuses to give him a free pass. It’s always much better to face up to your crimes than let a jury be the judge and jury.<br><br>
        Forcing Stanley to admit to his crimes in court is a worthwhile way to win back your friendship. Then you can ask if he’s still interested in building a relationship. You can see if he’s genuinely sorry. If not, you can quit taking him seriously and choose a good friend.<br><br>
