    <div class="News">
    <p>Our friend, Annie, has been struggling with a monkey meat addiction for many years. It started when she was in high school and has continued to plague her ever since. She was an all-star student, with a perfect attendance record and a 4.0 grade point average. But her addiction to monkey meat has taken its toll and her perfect school life has been ruined.</p>
<p>Annie's monkey meat addiction began when she was a freshman in high school. She would sneak away during lunch and after school to buy monkey meat from a local vendor. She was so secretive about it that even her closest friends had no idea what she was doing. Initially, Annie thought that the monkey meat she was eating was harmless, but she soon realized it was causing her to become increasingly sick and weak.</p>
<p>As her addiction to monkey meat progressed, Annie's grades began to suffer. She was unable to focus in class and her attendance record began to slip. She was eventually suspended from school for missing too many classes. Despite her best efforts, Annie was unable to kick her monkey meat addiction and she eventually dropped out of school.</p>
<p>Annie's addiction to monkey meat has had a devastating effect on her life. She has lost her perfect attendance record, her good grades, and her friends. Her family has been deeply affected as well. They have tried their best to help her, but nothing has worked.</p>
<p>Annie's addiction to monkey meat is a serious problem and it is not something that can be solved overnight. It will take a great deal of time and effort to help her overcome her addiction. We hope that with the right help and support, Annie can get her life back on track and reclaim her perfect school life.</p>
